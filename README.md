A basic starter kit for a HTML5 website

A quick and easy starter pack for a flat HTML5 site, using PHP.  Combines a variety of the internets best open source packages including:

* **HTML5 Boilerplate** - The de facto starter pack for any HTML5 website.  h5bp is used for the structure of the HTML template, as well as .htaccess rules, javascript organisation and other things you may forget about
* **Twitter Bootstrap 3.0** - The latest version of Bootstrap, bringing in mobile first methodology and a vast array of helper classes and modules
* **LESS Elements** - A handy collection of mixins allowing for some great css
* **LESSPHP** - For me, preprocessed CSS allows for smarter, more DRY styling, with mixins allowing for some amazing CSS properties.  Server side processing seems better, and this script provides that function.  This script simply gets included in your site header, and straight away you have a compressed version of your CSS available to you.
* **TimThumb** - In the age of responsive design, it's important to ensure your images are appropriate for your device.  TimThumb helps you achieve that by allowing you to crop images to different dimensions.  Combine this with a <picture> plugin and your responsive images are sorted!
